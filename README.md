## 📊 Input Data

The simulator requires several CSV files:

### Required Files

- `params.csv` - Electoral parameters (thresholds, bonuses)

### Input Data Format

**votes_marche_*_all_provinces.csv:**
```csv
province,list,coalition,president,votes
Ancona,Partito Democratico,Centrosinistra,Matteo Ricci,49000
Ancona,Fratelli d'Italia,Centrodestra,Francesco Acquaroli,48000
...
```

**seats_per_province.csv:**
```csv
province,seats
Ancona,9
Ascoli Piceno,4
Fermo,4
Macerata,6
Pesaro e Urbino,7
```

**params.csv:**
```csv
key,value
TOTAL_LIST_SEATS,30
BONUS_TARGET_PCT_19,0.43
BONUS_TARGET_PCT_18,0.40
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Execution
```bash
python ERM.py
```

### Output Files Generated
- `provincial_results.csv` - Detailed allocation by province and list
- `coalition_seats.csv` - Seats per coalition
- `group_seats.csv` - Seats per list/group
- `runnerup_reserved.csv` - Runner-up seat information
- `province_seat_report.md` - Detailed Markdown report
- `ripartizioneSeggi_finale.pdf` - Official-style PDF report

## 📈 Electoral Process Flow

### 1. Coalition Admission (Art. 18)
- **5% threshold** for coalitions OR
- **3% threshold** for individual lists
- Filters out non-qualifying coalitions/lists

### 2. D'Hondt Allocation with Bonus (Art. 19)
- Proportional seat distribution among admitted coalitions
- **Minimum bonus system**: Leading coalition gets at least 19 seats if ≥43% votes, 18 seats if ≥40%

### 3. Group Seat Distribution (Art. 19)
- Coalition seats distributed to individual lists using D'Hondt
- Each list gets seats proportional to their votes within the coalition

### 4. Provincial Integer Allocation (Art. 19)
- **Provincial quota**: `total_votes ÷ (seats + 1)` per province
- **Integer seats**: `list_votes ÷ provincial_quota` (integer part)
- **Residual calculation**: Remaining vote percentage after integer allocation

### 5. Residual Seat Assignment (Art. 19)
- **Regional ranking**: All residuals ranked by percentage across provinces
- **Group caps**: Enforce maximum seats per list
- **Sequential allocation**: Highest residuals get remaining seats

### 6. Runner-up Reserve (Art. 19)
- Ensures second-place presidential coalition has representation
- Only removes seats if runner-up has no representation

## 🔍 Key Functions

### Core Algorithm Functions
- `coalitions_stage()` - Coalition admission and D'Hondt allocation
- `group_seats_stage()` - Distribute coalition seats to lists
- `provincial_integers()` - Calculate provincial quotas and integer seats
- `assign_residuals()` - Regional residual ranking and allocation
- `reserve_runner_up()` - Handle runner-up seat reservation

### Utility Functions
- `dhondt()` - D'Hondt proportional allocation method
- `calculate_provincial_quota()` - Provincial quota calculations
- `generate_province_seat_markdown()` - Markdown report generation
- `generate_province_seat_pdf()` - PDF report generation

## 📊 Output Analysis

### Provincial Reports
Each province shows:
- **Quota calculation**: `admitted_votes ÷ (seats + 1)`
- **Integer seats**: Direct allocation from quotas
- **Residual percentages**: `(votes - integer_quota) ÷ total_votes × 100`
- **Regional ranking**: Position in regional residual hierarchy
- **Final allocation**: Integer + residual seats

### Coalition Analysis
- Vote percentages and seat proportions
- Bonus system application
- D'Hondt allocation results
